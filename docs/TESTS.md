# Testing

To help maintain this repo, we have included a number of tests. These can be run via [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). 
Many of these tests are unit tests; however, others test the integration of the whole system by overfitting to a small subset of the development data. 
Accordingly, running the whole pytest suite requires a significant amount of time and may use a significant percentage of your machine's memory.
