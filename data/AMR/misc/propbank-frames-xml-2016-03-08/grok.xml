      <note>GROK-V NOTES: This word was invented by Robert Heinlein in 'Stranger in a StrangeLand' to denote an experience alien to the human condition. As such,it is largely undefined--indeed, most of the story is devoted to ahuman learning what 'grokking' is all about. In later usage, 'grok'has been shifted to mean 'to understand (fully)' which, while takingthe same argument structure (except not the intransitive), loses muchof the magic of the original. (from grok.01-v)</note>
