        <note>The original note here said that non-adjectival usage, particularly usage with arg0, was basically obsolete. Clearly this is not the case, although it's interesting to note that it begins to sound a little stranger when both arg0 and arg1 are human. It is more usual to encounter this verb with either an inanimate causal arg0, or an inhuman animate arg1. But any combination is still possible. (from accustom.01-v)</note>
