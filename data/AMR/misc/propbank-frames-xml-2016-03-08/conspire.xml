      <note>CONSPIRE-V NOTES: Frames file for 'conspired' based on sentences in financial subcorpus. No Verbnet entry. Comparison with 'work'.True etymological tidbit: "conspire" comes from the Latin for "tobreathe together", since conspirators inevitably huddle together whenhatching their nefarious plans. Actually, I just really like the word "nefarious." (from conspire.01-v predicate notes)</note>
