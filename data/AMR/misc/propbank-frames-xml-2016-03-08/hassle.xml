        <note>This nominalization seems to express a slightly different event situation from the verb frame. There is not expected to be an agentive hasller here, but there is a thing that is a hassle as well as a specific aspect of that thing that is a hassle, which is why the args are different. Compare instead to 'burden-n.01'. (from hassle.01-n)</note>
