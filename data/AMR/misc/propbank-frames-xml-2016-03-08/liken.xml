      <note>LIKE-V NOTES: PReditor picks up prepositional usages of "like" (meaning "such as"and tagged as adjective) which should be ignored. Even worse,"unlike" is picked up and included in the .arch files, so you'll seesome sentences which at first glance seem to have no "like" predicatesat all. (from like.01-v)</note>
      <note>LIKING-N NOTES: Added by Julia based on BOLT, like-v.01. Corresponds to VNcls admire-31.2-1, want-32.1-1-1. (from liking.01-n)</note>

        <note>This is a (relatively rare) case where a sentence with 'would like' is annotated as like-01. Here, the 'would' marks the hypothetical, reflecting the assumption of the speaker that 'you' have not seen the movie yet, and therefore can't yet like or not like the movie.</note>
