      <note>DISALLOW-V NOTES: The 'in favor of...' clause is problematic. It's marked as -CLR intreebank, but I think that misses the generalization that 'in favorof' can be attached to any verb of dispreferring. I feel 'in favorof' to be a predicate in its own right, similar to comparatives, andtherefore safely postponed until we deal with that question. (from disallow.01-v)</note>
