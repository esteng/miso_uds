Please note the following as you review :	INTJ,VERB,DET,VERB,SCONJ,PRON,VERB,PUNCT
1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer 's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer 's utility .

2 . I did not include a " Setoff " provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers .	X,PUNCT,PRON,AUX,PART,VERB,DET,PUNCT,NOUN,PUNCT,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,ADV,SCONJ,DET,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,PRON,AUX,PART,PUNCT,CONJ,AUX,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,VERB,DET,NOUN,ADP,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT

3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we 've had great difficulty selling it in the past ) .

Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a " force majeure event " in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs ) .	VERB,ADP,NOUN,DET,NOUN,ADP,NOUN,PUNCT,PRON,VERB,PART,VERB,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,VERB,PRON,NOUN,PART,VERB,PRON,NOUN,ADP,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,NOUN,PUNCT,NOUN,CONJ,NOUN,ADP,DET,PUNCT,NOUN,NOUN,NOUN,PUNCT,ADP,DET,NOUN,PART,VERB,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,VERB,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,PUNCT
Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again , more in the interest of " saving space " than anything else ...

But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President .
